Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI::Guides::Security - How to secure your API

=head1 OVERVIEW

This guide will give you an introduction on how to use the security features
in OpenAPI, together with L<Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI>.

Note that this is currently EXPERIMENTAL! Please let me know if you have any
feedback. See
L<https://github.com/jhthorsen/mojolicious-plugin-openapi/pull/40> for a
complete discussion.

=head1 TUTORIAL

=head2 Specification

Here is an example specification that use
L<securityDefinitions|http://swagger.io/specification/#securityDefinitionsObject>
and L<security|http://swagger.io/specification/#securityRequirementObject> from
the OpenAPI spec:

  {
    "swagger": "2.0",
    "info": { "version": "0.8", "title": "Super secure" },
    "schemes": [ "https" ],
    "basePath": "/api",
    "securityDefinitions": {
      "dummy": {
        "type": "apiKey",
        "name": "Authorization",
        "in": "header",
        "description": "dummy"
      }
    },
    "paths": {
      "/protected": {
        "post": {
          "x-mojo-to": "super#secret_resource",
          "security": [{"dummy": []}],
          "parameters": [
            { "in": "body", "name": "body", "schema": { "type": "object" } }
          ],
          "responses": {
            "200": {"description": "Echo response", "schema": { "type": "object" }},
            "401": {"description": "Sorry mate", "schema": { "type": "array" }}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

=head2 Application

The specification above can be dispatched to handlers inside your
L<Mojolicious> application. The do so, add the "security" key when loading the
plugin, and reference the "securityDefinitions" name inside that to a callback.
In this example, we have the "dummy" security handler:

  package Myapp;
  use Mojo::Base "Mojolicious";

  sub startup {
    my $app = shift;

    $app->plugin(OpenAPI => {
      url      => "data://main/sec.json",
      security => {
        dummy => sub {
          my ($c, $security, $next) = @_;
          return $c->$next if $c->req->headers->authorization;
          return $c->render(openapi => $security, status => 401);
        }
      }
    });
  }

  1;

C<$c> is a L<Mojolicious::Controller> object. C<$security> is the in this case
is just an empty array ref, but it will contain the value for "security" under
the given HTTP method. C<$next> is the method you need to call, if this security
check passed.

At any point, you can call L<Mojolicious::Controller/render> to prevent
L<Mojolicious::Please::OpenAPI> from dispatching to your action.

The first thing in your code that you need to do is to load this plugin and the
L</Specification>. See L<Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI/register> for information
about what the plugin config can be.

See also L<Mojolicious::Plugin::OpenAPI/SYNOPSIS> for example
L<Mojolicious::Lite> application.

=head2 Controller

Your controllers and actions are unchanged. The difference in behavior is that
the action simply won't be called if you fail to pass the security tests.
